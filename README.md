# medical-rag-chatbot
A simple Medical Chatbot built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It searches medical text with FAISS and uses an AI model to generate accurate answers from real documents. This repo includes chunking, indexing, retrieval, and response generation—making it easy to understand and run a complete RAG pipeline.
